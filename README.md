Expense Tracker
- Objective: Develop a basic expense tracking application in Java.
- Details: This project will allow you to apply your Java programming skills to create a useful application. Here are the key features your Expense Tracker should have:
  - Add Expenses: Users should be able to input their daily expenses. Each expense entry should include a description, amount, and category (e.g., groceries, transportation, entertainment).
   - View Expenses: Users should be able to view a list of their recorded expenses, including details such as the description, amount, and category.
   - Expense Summaries: Implement functionality to provide expense summaries, such as total expenses for a specific category or for a given time period.
  - User-Friendly Interface: Design a user-friendly interface that prompts users to input their expenses and displays summaries clearly.
   - Data Persistence: Ensure that the entered expenses are saved and can be accessed in future sessions.
   - Input Validation: Handle input validation to ensure that users enter valid expense details.
